Hackathon Feedback

Technology 6/8: The project integrates advanced technologies, including using PostgreSQL for database management and tabulate for displaying tabular data. The code demonstrates a solid understanding of database operations, such as creating tables, inserting data, and performing queries to pair students based on common characteristics. To improve, consider implementing more advanced matching algorithms to enhance the pairing process.

Completion 7/8: The project is functional, allowing users to register students, fill out characteristics, and automatically pair them based on commonalities. While most features are implemented and working, there are minor areas that could be refined, such as handling edge cases for user inputs more robustly.

Learning 8/8: The project shows extensive learning effort, including database management, complex SQL queries, and building an interactive user interface. The student has demonstrated a deep understanding of handling user inputs, performing database operations, and displaying results in a user-friendly manner. Further enhancements could include implementing a web-based interface for broader accessibility and incorporating feedback mechanisms to improve pairing accuracy.
